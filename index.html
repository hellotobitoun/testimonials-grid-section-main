                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, 
                    if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth

                    "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make
                    a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                    free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - 
                    and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully
                    switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR tsartup."

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
                    to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
                    and I never had to wait for long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                    tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a 
                    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!."
